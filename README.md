# Sess

Sess is an app that brings people together through Listening Sessions. Listening Sessions are a way for new and old friends to share music and stories with one another in a casual, relaxing setting. Sessions usually consists of 6-10 people who will take turn sharing their prepared playlists to the group. Each participant will have a maximum of 3 tracks they will be able to share/DJ. Before each track plays, the sharer/DJ will tell the group what this particular song means to them/what it reminds them of and why they decided on it. 

The app allows for easy personal tracklist creation, and scheduling for the next session. Users can create an account and have access to thier profile. In the user profile, there will be a personal tracklist only viewable to the logged in user. There is also a session list where users will be able to either host or attend an upcoming session. When the user selects host, it will be automatically added to their session list. When the user selects attend, they will be able to browse a list of all sessions that other users created and can choose to attend the sessions. When the user decide to attend, the session will be added to the user's sess's list in their profile. Alternatively, if the user decide to no longer attend the session, they can remove from their profile sess list and it will not affect any other users.  

The goal is share this app amongst friends at first, then gradually branch out to a larger circle. Currently, Listening Sessions are held in the cities of San Francisco, Washington DC, and New York City.
